# Single Cycle 16-bit MIPS Processor
This project shows the implementation of 16 bit single cycle MIPS processor. The Instruction Set Architecture of this MIPS processor includes the following instructions.
1) ADD
2) SUB
3) AND
4) OR
5) SLT
6) JR
7) LW
8) SW
9) BEQ
10) ADDI
11) SLTI
12) J
13) JAL
<br> <br> The above instructions are classified into R, I and J type instructions. The format for R, I and J type instructions are as follows.
